## 4. TASKS TO SCHEDULE (Prioritized by Urgency)
**CRITICAL CONTEXT**: For multi-step tasks, priority is calculated based on TOTAL remaining work vs deadline.
### T1 - CRITICAL URGENCY - 1 tasks, 1.0h
These require >8h/day of work to meet deadline, or are past due. MUST schedule today.

- **Opruimen**
  - Effort: 1.0h
  - Deadline: 2025-11-14 (0.3 days) | Need: 1.0h/day

  - THIS task: 1.0h | TOTAL project: 34.5h remaining
  - Deadline: 2025-12-20 (36.3 days) | Need: 1.0h/day to finish on time

Try to plan tasks for more time than their project requires per day, otherwise the deadline will be missed.
A single caledar input does not need to be the whole task, and if a task is long its pieces may be planned as multiple events over the course of a day. And even if the full task cannot be completed it is good to plan a part: something is better than nothing.
Remember to change the time of the end of each event, so that the pieces of tasks do not become doubly planned agenda items.

## 5. HABITS TO SCHEDULE
Tasks take absolute priority. Only include habits that fit after T1/T2 tasks are scheduled.
Aim for a Task:Habit ratio of 3:1. Just plan tasks first, and see which habits are possible after.
The time habits take is very flexible and can be increased or decreased with up to 50%, if desired.Reading must happen every day and the minimum time requirement is low: as few as 20 minutes can already be a reading event.
